# Shareable Workout Link Implementation - Kickoff Prompt

## Task Summary
Implement functional public workout record sharing via Next.js dynamic routes using nevent URLs. The task extends existing `SocialSharingService` with nevent decoding methods, creates a `PublicWorkoutDisplay` component reusing `WorkoutHistoryDetailModal` patterns, and updates the dynamic route to fetch and display workout data using established NDK `useSubscribe` patterns.

**Key Technical Approach**: Extend existing services rather than creating new utilities, reuse 90% of `WorkoutHistoryDetailModal` logic, and leverage established NDK integration patterns for seamless public workout sharing.

**Primary Goal**: Enable users to share workout records publicly through nevent URLs that work for both authenticated and non-authenticated users, maintaining architectural consistency with existing patterns.

## Starting Point
Begin by extending the `SocialSharingService` with nevent decoding methods (`decodeWorkoutNevent`, `validateWorkoutNevent`, `extractEventIdFromNevent`) using the existing `nip19` import. This establishes the foundation for the route implementation and component data fetching.

**First Step**: Add the nevent decoding methods to `SocialSharingService` following the existing service patterns (pure functions, no NDK operations, proper error handling).

**Dependencies to Check**: Verify that `nostr-tools` is available (already imported in `socialSharingService`) and that the existing `generateWorkoutRecordNevent` method works correctly as a reference for the decoding implementation.
