# Workout PWA Project Kickoff Document

**Project Name**: Workout PWA  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Target MVP**: 10 days from start  
**Last Updated**: Initial creation

## Project Overview

### Vision
Build a fitness tracking Progressive Web App (PWA) using Next.js and NDK (Nostr Development Kit) to validate NDK-first architecture patterns before applying lessons learned to enhance the existing golf app.

## Primary Architectural Hypothesis

**Core Question**: Can NDK IndexedDB cache + Nostr events completely replace custom database architecture for complex real-time applications?

**Current Problem**: My existing golf and fitness apps (powr and noga) use dual-database approach:
- Custom SQLite database for app data
- NDK SQLite cache for Nostr events  
- Complex field mapping between systems
- Manual sync logic and data duplication

**Proposed Solution**: Single NDK-first architecture:
- NDK IndexedDB cache as only persistence layer
- Nostr events (NIP-101e) as primary data model
- No custom database, no field mapping, no sync complexity
- Add custom analytics database ONLY if needed later for gamekeeper features

**Success = Proof**: If workout tracking works seamlessly with just NDK cache + events, then we can confidently refactor the golf app to eliminate database complexity.

### Core Goals
1. **Validate NDK-first architecture** for complex real-time tracking applications
2. **Prove XState patterns work seamlessly** with Nostr event-driven data
3. **Build genuinely useful fitness app** with social features via Nostr protocol
4. **Create proven patterns** for later golf app refactoring
5. **Rapid iteration and user feedback** without App Store constraints

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Complete workout flow: Template selection → Active tracking → Event publishing
- ✅ Offline functionality with automatic sync when online
- ✅ NIP-101e compliance for all workout events
- ✅ XState machines managing complex workout state
- ✅ User authentication via NIP-07 (browser extensions)
- ✅ Social discovery of workout templates from other users
- ✅ Zero custom database code - All persistence via NDK cache
- ✅ Events as data model - No object-relational mapping needed
- ✅ Simplified architecture - Single source of truth for data

## Technical Architecture

### Stack Decision
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **State Management**: XState v5 (proven patterns from golf app)
- **Nostr Integration**: NDK browser packages
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Mantine UI components
- **Caching**: NDKCacheAdapterDexie (IndexedDB)
- **Authentication**: NIP-07 browser extensions + private key fallback

### NDK Browser Setup
```typescript
// Core packages (WEB versions, not mobile)
"@nostr-dev-kit/ndk": "latest"
"@nostr-dev-kit/ndk-cache-dexie": "latest"
"xstate": "^5.x"
"@xstate/react": "^4.x"
```

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Events as Data Model**: NIP-101e events (kinds 33401, 33402, 1301) are primary data structure
- **No Custom Database**: NDK IndexedDB cache handles all persistence
- **Local-First**: Full offline functionality with sync when online
- **XState for Complex State**: Workout setup, active tracking, publishing workflows

## NIP-101e Implementation Scope

### Event Types (MVP)
- **Kind 33401**: Exercise Templates (use existing community templates)
- **Kind 33402**: Workout Templates (browse/select existing templates)
- **Kind 1301**: Workout Records (create from completed workouts)

### Workout Flow
```
Browse Templates (33402) → Setup Workout (XState) → Track Sets/Reps (XState) → Publish Record (1301)
```

### MVP Limitations (Deliberate)
- ❌ No exercise template creation (use existing ones)
- ❌ No complex analytics (focus on core tracking)
- ❌ No advanced social features (basic discovery only)
- ❌ No gamification/leaderboards (save for later)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
**Day 1**: Next.js + NDK setup, basic authentication  
**Day 2**: NIP-101e event utilities, test publishing/reading  
**Day 3**: XState machine adaptation from golf app patterns  

**Deliverables**: Working NDK integration, basic event publishing, adapted state machines

### Phase 2: Core Workflow (Days 4-7)
**Day 4**: Active workout machine with timer  
**Day 5**: Template browser UI  
**Day 6**: Active workout interface  
**Day 7**: Workout completion and publishing  

**Deliverables**: End-to-end workout flow, working UI components

### Phase 3: PWA Features (Days 8-10)
**Day 8**: Service worker setup, offline queue  
**Day 9**: Error handling, loading states  
**Day 10**: Testing, polish, deployment  

**Deliverables**: Production-ready PWA with offline support

## Development Environment

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Project initialization
npx create-next-app@latest workout-pwa --typescript --tailwind --app
cd workout-pwa

# Core dependencies
npm install @nostr-dev-kit/ndk @nostr-dev-kit/ndk-cache-dexie
npm install xstate @xstate/react
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @tabler/icons-react

# PWA support
npm install next-pwa

# Development tools
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

### Relay Testing Strategy
**Recommendation**: Use public relays initially, add local relay only if needed.

**Public Relays for Testing**:
- `wss://relay.damus.io` (reliable, fast)
- `wss://nos.lol` (good performance)
- `wss://relay.primal.net` (Nostr-native)

**Local Relay Setup** (Optional):
```bash
# Only if public relays are insufficient
git clone https://github.com/hoytech/strfry
cd strfry
docker build -t strfry .
docker run -p 7777:7777 strfry
```

**Why Public Relays First**:
- ✅ Zero setup complexity
- ✅ Real-world testing conditions
- ✅ Existing workout templates to discover
- ✅ Social features work immediately
- ✅ NDK outbox model optimization

## Key Learnings from Golf App

### What Worked Well (Keep)
- ✅ XState machines for complex state management
- ✅ Local-first approach with sync
- ✅ Professional UI patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Offline-first mentality

### What to Simplify (Improve)
- ❌ Dual database complexity → Single NDK cache
- ❌ Manual field mapping → Events as canonical format
- ❌ Custom sync logic → NDK automatic sync
- ❌ Complex repository patterns → Simple event utilities

### Proven Patterns to Transfer
- **XState Machine Architecture**: Setup → Active → Completed workflows
- **Error Boundary Patterns**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Timer Management**: Real-time updates and background timers
- **Offline Queue**: Automatic sync when connectivity restored

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **NDK Browser Performance**: Mitigation via IndexedDB benchmarking
2. **XState Integration Complexity**: Leverage proven golf app patterns
3. **Event Structure Evolution**: Design for NIP-101e extensibility

### User Experience Risks
1. **Authentication Friction**: NIP-07 detection + smooth fallbacks
2. **First-time User Onboarding**: Clear explanation of Nostr benefits
3. **Workout Discovery**: Curate initial set of quality templates

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Strict MVP boundaries, resist feature additions
