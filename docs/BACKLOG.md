  - Issue: PWA installation not working despite 4+ hours of troubleshooting
  - All technical requirements appear met (favicon, icons, manifest, service worker)
  - May require production HTTPS environment for proper testing
  - Consider using PWA testing tools or different browsers
  - Alternative: Focus on web app functionality, defer PWA installation
  - **Context**: Spent significant time on favicon, icon sizes, manifest configuration
  - **Files Modified**: layout.tsx, manifest.json, service worker, all icon files
  - **Status**: Technical implementation complete, installation still failing

### Core Workout Features (MVP)
- [ ] **NIP-101e Workout Event Publishing** (L)
  - Create workout event generation system
  - Implement event validation and publishing
  - Build workout completion flow
  - Related: `docs/nip-101e-specification.md`

  - Rest period management
  - Progress indicators

## ðŸŸ¡ High Priority

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] **Log Tab Real-Time Updates** (S)
  - **Issue**: Log Tab not refreshing/updating with new completed workouts after publishing 1301 events
  - **Context**: WorkoutHistoryProvider has multiple real-time update mechanisms (PARALLEL strategy, 'powr-workout-complete' event listener, pull-to-refresh) but updates not reflecting in UI
  - **Impact**: Users don't see their completed workouts immediately after finishing them
  - **Files**: `src/components/tabs/LogTab.tsx`, `src/providers/WorkoutHistoryProvider.tsx`
  - **Investigation Needed**: Determine why existing real-time infrastructure isn't working

- [ ] **Global Search Enhancement** (M)
  - Add filtering capabilities (difficulty, muscle groups, equipment, duration)
  - Expand search to include Kind 33401 (Exercise Templates)
  - Add Kind 30003 (Collections) search support
  - Implement search result categorization and tabs
  - Add advanced search operators and saved searches
  - **Context**: Currently searches Kind 33402 (Workout Templates) only
  - **Files**: `src/components/search/GlobalWorkoutSearch.tsx`, `src/lib/services/searchService.ts`

- [ ] **UI Layout Standardization** (M)
  - Create semantic layout wrapper components (FeedLayout, ContentLayout, WorkoutLayout)
  - Standardize tab layout patterns while preserving UX differences
  - Migrate existing tabs to use standardized components
  - Related: `docs/tasks/ui-layout-standardization-task.md`

- [ ] **User Profile Management** (M)
  - Profile creation and editing
  - Avatar and bio management
  - Workout history display

- [ ] **Social Features** (L)
  - Like and comment on workout events
  - Follow other users
  - Workout feed and discovery

- [ ] **PWA Enhancements** (M)
  - Service worker implementation
  - Offline workout tracking
  - Push notifications for workout reminders

## ðŸŸ¢ Normal Priority

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] **Weight Unit Preference System Enhancement** (M)
  - **Issue**: WorkoutHistoryDetailModal shows hardcoded kg units, settings drawer needed for better UX
  - **Phase 1**: Fix broken components not respecting weight unit preference (30 min)
  - **Phase 2**: Add settings drawer with weight unit toggle for better discoverability (2-3 hours)
  - **Phase 3**: Comprehensive audit of all weight displays (1 hour)
  - **Benefits**: Global preference system, instant synchronization, better UX
  - **Architecture**: Current WeightUnitsProvider + useWeightUnits hook supports enhancement seamlessly
  - **Task**: `docs/tasks/weight-unit-preference-system-enhancement-task.md`

- **Smart Workout Confirmations** - Context-aware confirmation dialogs for CRUD operations that prevent accidental data loss while reducing confirmation fatigue
  - Priority: Medium
  - Effort: 7-10 hours (M)
  - Dependencies: None (builds on existing CRUD functionality)
  - Task: `docs/tasks/smart-workout-confirmations-implementation-task.md`

### Active Workout Enhancements
- [ ] **Duplicate Exercise Instance Tracking Fix** (M)
  - **Issue**: Adding same exercise multiple times causes set completion interference
  - **Impact**: Creates malformed NIP-101e events with incorrect set numbering
  - **Solution**: Implement continuous set numbering + UI instance differentiation
  - **Features**: "Round 2" labeling, set ranges ("Sets 1-3" vs "Sets 4-6"), independent tracking
  - **Timeline**: 2-3 days implementation
  - **Related**: `docs/tasks/duplicate-exercise-instance-tracking-fix-task.md`
  - **Context**: Discovered during CRUD operations testing, affects workout event publishing

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] **Authentication/Publishing Separation Architecture Enhancement** (M)
  - **Context**: Current fix reduces NIP-07 auth from 10s to instant by separating auth from relay connections
  - **Opportunity**: Further optimize by creating separate "minimal NDK" for authentication vs "full NDK" for publishing
  - **Benefits**: Even faster auth, cleaner separation of concerns, better error isolation
  - **Implementation**: Create `createAuthNDK()` (no relays) and `createPublishingNDK()` (with relays)
  - **Impact**: Authentication becomes truly instant, publishing operations handle their own relay requirements
  - **Priority**: Medium - current fix works well, this would be architectural improvement

- [ ] **Fix ESLint errors in test files** (S)
  - Multiple ESLint errors in src/components/test/ files
  - Issues: unescaped entities, @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any, unused variables
  - Currently disabled ESLint during builds for deployment
  - Should fix errors and re-enable linting for better code quality
  - **Context**: ESLint disabled in next.config.ts for Vercel deployment

- [ ] **Service Layer Extraction for activeWorkoutMachine** (M)
  - Extract template loading service (~150 lines of complex fallback logic)
  - Extract workout data transformation service (CompletedWorkout format conversion)
  - Extract exercise progression calculations (set number calculation with boundary protection)
  - Extract timing and session management service (duration calculations, pause time tracking)
  - **Benefits**: Improved testability, reusability, maintainability, and performance
  - **Context**: activeWorkoutMachine is getting large (~700+ lines) with significant business logic that could be extracted following service-layer-architecture.md patterns

- [ ] **Hydration Error Audit** (S)
  - Remove all `suppressHydrationWarning` flags temporarily
  - Document exact hydration errors that appear
  - Fix any real issues found
  - Only re-add suppression for truly acceptable differences
  - **Context**: Currently using suppressHydrationWarning on main page and callback page containers after fixing major Jotai and window access issues

- [ ] **Performance Optimization** (M)
  - Bundle size analysis and optimization
  - Image optimization and lazy loading
  - Code splitting for better loading

- [ ] **Error Handling Enhancement** (S)
  - Global error boundary implementation
  - Better error messages and recovery
  - Offline error handling

### Data & Analytics
- [ ] **Workout Analytics** (M)
  - Progress tracking and charts
  - Personal records tracking
  - Workout streak counters

- [ ] **Data Export/Import** (S)
  - Export workout data
  - Import from other fitness apps
  - Backup and restore functionality

## ðŸ”µ Low Priority

### V1.1 Polish Features

#### Delete/Remove Set Functionality
**Priority**: Low (Polish Feature)
**Effort**: 2 hours (XS)
**Description**: Allow users to remove individual sets during active workouts with iOS/Android-style selection mode.

**Technical Approach**:
- Enhanced UX with "Remove Sets" option in ExerciseMenuDropdown
- Selection mode with delete toggles on left of set rows
- XState integration with REMOVE_SET event handler in activeWorkoutMachine
- Bulk delete action with confirmation dialog
- Edge case handling (minimum 1 set per exercise protection)

**Why Deferred**: Incomplete sets don't affect NIP-101e workout records (Kind 1301). Users can simply leave sets incomplete without impacting the published workout record. Higher-impact features like library buttons and NADDR search provide more user value for beta release.

**Implementation Details**: See `docs/tasks/delete-remove-set-functionality-implementation-task.md`

## Notes

### Technical Debt
- **Hydration Warnings**: Currently using `suppressHydrationWarning` on container elements after fixing major issues. Should audit to ensure no real problems are being masked.
- **Auto-logout**: Disabled automatic Amber authentication check during development - should re-enable for production.

### Architecture Decisions
- **NDK-First**: All data persistence through NDK cache, no custom database
- **Event-Driven**: NIP-101e workout events as primary data model
- **Web-Optimized**: Browser-specific patterns for authentication and caching

### Golf App Migration
All patterns and components are being designed for eventual migration to the golf app, particularly:
- Authentication system (proven and tested)
- Event publishing patterns
- State management architecture
- PWA infrastructure
