# Workout Collection & Dependency Resolution Sprint Implementation Task

## Objective
Implement and validate the "List of Lists" + Cache-Only Hydration architecture for workout/exercise dependency resolution using NIP-51 collections. This sprint proves that NDK cache can handle complex data dependencies automatically, eliminating the need for custom database complexity in the golf app migration.

## Current State Analysis
- **NDK Cache Validation**: Complete success - all 3 phases validated with 100% success rate
- **Test Infrastructure**: WorkoutPublisher, WorkoutReader, WorkoutListManager components functional
- **Performance Baseline**: 22.6ms average per event with 78+ events (exceeds 500ms target)
- **NIP-101e Utilities**: Working event generation in `src/lib/workout-events.ts`
- **Missing**: Dependency resolution architecture, NIP-51 collection management, cache hydration from subscriptions

## Technical Approach
- **Cache-Only Hydration**: Users subscribe to collections, cache automatically resolves all dependencies
- **No User List Management**: MVP focuses on subscription → cache → display flow only
- **Direct NDK Operations**: Prove concepts with existing test components, extract services later
- **Test-First Development**: Prove concepts through comprehensive testing before UI
- **Realistic Test Data**: Bodyweight exercises for actual workout testing later

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Test Content Creation & Publishing (Day 1)
1. [ ] **Create Test Exercise Library** (2 hours)
   - Extend existing `WorkoutPublisher` component for exercise publishing
   - Create 12 bodyweight exercises (4 per workout category)

### **Workout Templates (3 workouts)**

#### **POWR Test Push Workout**
- 4 exercises from push category
- 3 sets each, 8-12 reps
- 60-90 second rest periods

#### **POWR Test Pull Workout**
- 4 exercises from pull category
- 3 sets each, 5-10 reps (adjusted for difficulty)
- 90-120 second rest periods

#### **POWR Test Legs Workout**
- 4 exercises from legs category
- 3 sets each, 10-15 reps
- 60-90 second rest periods

### **Collection Structure**
- **POWR Test Strength Bodyweight Collection**: Contains all 3 workout templates
- **POWR Test Exercise Library**: Contains all 12 exercises
- **User Subscription List**: References both POWR collections

### **Exercise Media Strategy**
**Recommended Approach**: CDN + URL References
- **Media Storage**: Exercise images/GIFs served from CDN (not cached in NDK)
- **URL References**: Exercise events contain media URLs in content and tags
- **Offline Support**: Service Worker caches frequently accessed media
- **Storage Impact**: Minimal (~100 bytes per exercise for URLs vs 50-200KB for embedded media)
- **Performance**: Fast loading, browser-optimized caching, no IndexedDB bloat

**Example Exercise Event with Media:**
```json
{
  "kind": 33401,
  "content": "{\"name\":\"Standard Pushup\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://cdn.powr.app/exercises/pushup-standard.jpg\",\"gifUrl\":\"https://cdn.powr.app/exercises/pushup-standard.gif\"}",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "pushup-standard"],
    ["name", "Standard Pushup"],
    ["image", "https://cdn.powr.app/exercises/pushup-standard.jpg"],
    ["muscle", "chest"]
  ]
}
```

**Storage Comparison:**
- **CDN Approach**: 300 exercises × 100 bytes = 30KB additional
- **Embedded Approach**: 300 exercises × 200KB average = 60MB additional
- **Recommendation**: CDN approach keeps NDK cache lean and performant

## Web-Specific Considerations

### Browser Environment Optimization
- Leverage existing NDK cache performance (22.6ms baseline)
- Use proven IndexedDB patterns from validation sprint
- Optimize for multiple tab scenarios
- Handle browser storage quotas gracefully

### Service Worker Integration
- Cache collection data for offline access
- Background sync for collection updates
- Progressive enhancement for network-dependent features
- Offline queue for subscription changes

### Performance Monitoring
- Dependency resolution timing
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Collection update propagation speed
- Memory usage during large dependency trees

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks & Fallbacks
- **Collection Complexity**: Start with simple flat collections, add nesting later
- **Performance Issues**: Implement pagination and lazy loading for large collections
- **Cache Corruption**: Robust error handling and cache rebuilding
- **Network Issues**: Offline-first design with graceful degradation

### Sprint Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope Creep**: Focus on dependency resolution only, no UI polish
- **Service Complexity**: Keep services simple and focused
- **Test Data Quality**: Realistic but minimal data set
- **Integration Challenges**: Build on proven NDK validation patterns
