# Library CRUD Removal Persistence Fix Task

## Objective
Fix the issue where removed exercises and workout templates continue to appear in the UI despite successful collection updates and cache invalidation attempts.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Collection operations (NIP-51) successfully remove items from collections
- Cache event service fires correctly after removals
- Refetch operations are triggered properly
- Collection counts update correctly (exerciseCount: 12 ‚Üí 8, workoutCount: 3 ‚Üí 2)
- Toast notifications show successful removal

### What's Broken ‚ùå
- Removed items still appear in the UI after removal operations
- DependencyResolutionService continues to resolve "removed" exercise templates
- Cache strategy (CACHE_FIRST) returns cached data for items no longer in collections
- UI doesn't reflect the actual collection state after removals

### Console Log Evidence
```
[LibraryCollectionService] ‚úÖ Removed from EXERCISE_LIBRARY collection
[CacheEventService] üîÑ Cache invalidation triggered for exercises
[LibraryDataProvider] üîÑ Refetching exercises after cache event
[DependencyResolutionService] ‚úÖ Fetched 8 events in 414ms using CACHE_FIRST
[DataParsingService] ‚úÖ Parsed exercise template: Standard Pushup  // ‚Üê This was "removed" but still shows up!
```

## Technical Approach

### Root Cause Hypothesis
The issue is in the **dependency resolution chain**, not cache invalidation:

1. **Collection Update**: ‚úÖ Items removed from NIP-51 collections
2. **Dependency Resolution**: ‚ùå Still resolves cached exercise/template events
3. **Data Filtering**: ‚ùå No filtering based on collection membership
4. **UI Update**: ‚ùå Shows resolved data regardless of collection state

### Investigation Areas

#### 1. DependencyResolutionService Analysis
- **File**: `src/lib/services/dependencyResolutionService.ts`
- **Issue**: Service resolves exercise references without checking collection membership
- **Expected**: Should only resolve items that exist in current collections

#### 2. LibraryDataProvider Data Flow
- **File**: `src/providers/LibraryDataProvider.tsx`
- **Issue**: Provider may not properly filter resolved data against collection state
- **Expected**: Should filter resolved exercises/templates by collection membership

#### 3. Cache Strategy Evaluation
- **Current**: Using `CACHE_FIRST` strategy for dependency resolution
- **Issue**: Returns cached data for items no longer in collections
- **Options**: Consider `PARALLEL` or collection-aware caching

#### 4. Data Flow Architecture
```

                                                        ‚Üë
                                                   Problem Area
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis
1. [ ] **Analyze DependencyResolutionService**
   - Review how exercise references are resolved
   - Identify where collection membership should be checked
   - Document current resolution logic

2. [ ] **Trace LibraryDataProvider Data Flow**
   - Map the complete data flow from collection to UI
   - Identify where filtering should occur
   - Document current provider logic

3. [ ] **Examine Cache Strategy Impact**
   - Test different cache strategies (CACHE_FIRST vs PARALLEL)
   - Analyze cache behavior after collection updates
   - Document cache invalidation effectiveness

### Phase 2: Root Cause Identification
4. [ ] **Identify Exact Failure Point**
   - Pinpoint where removed items should be filtered out
   - Determine if issue is in resolution or filtering
   - Create minimal reproduction case

5. [ ] **Evaluate Architecture Options**
   - Option A: Filter in DependencyResolutionService
   - Option B: Filter in LibraryDataProvider
   - Option C: Collection-aware caching strategy
   - Option D: Hybrid approach

### Phase 3: Implementation
6. [ ] **Implement Chosen Solution**
   - Apply fix at identified failure point
   - Ensure collection membership is respected
   - Maintain performance characteristics

7. [ ] **Test and Validate**
   - Verify removed items no longer appear in UI
   - Confirm collection operations still work
   - Test cache invalidation effectiveness

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics (80% threshold)
- [ ] **Immediate UI Update**: Removed items disappear from UI within 2 seconds
- [ ] **Collection Consistency**: UI reflects actual collection state
- [ ] **No Phantom Items**: Zero removed items appearing in resolved data
- [ ] **Performance Maintained**: Resolution time stays under 500ms

### Secondary Success Metrics
- [ ] **Cache Efficiency**: Proper cache utilization without stale data
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of resolution failures
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Clear toast notifications for all operations

## Technical Constraints

### Service Layer Architecture Compliance
- **Follow**: `.clinerules/service-layer-architecture.md`
- **Maintain**: Facade pattern for backward compatibility
- **Ensure**: No duplicate service calls across hierarchy

### NDK-First Architecture
- **Preserve**: NDK cache as primary data source
- **Maintain**: Event-driven data model
- **Avoid**: Custom database complexity

### Performance Requirements
- **Resolution Time**: < 500ms for dependency resolution
- **UI Update Time**: < 2 seconds for removal reflection
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Maintain current cache efficiency

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring UI always reflects collection state
- **Performance Impact**: Avoiding additional service calls
- **Cache Invalidation**: Proper cache management without over-invalidation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each phase before proceeding
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain current working collection operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track resolution times throughout changes

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1 (Investigation)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2 (Root Cause)**: 1-2 hours  
- **Phase 3 (Implementation)**: 2-4 hours
- **Total**: 5-9 hours over 2-3 sessions
