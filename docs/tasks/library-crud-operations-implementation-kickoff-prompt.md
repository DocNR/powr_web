# Library CRUD Operations Implementation - Kickoff Prompt

## Task Summary
Implement complete library CRUD operations enabling users to add/remove exercises and workout templates from their personal collections. This builds directly on existing service layer and UI components that are 90% complete.

## Key Technical Approach
- **Service Integration**: Use existing `libraryManagementService.addToLibraryCollection()` and `removeFromLibraryCollection()`
- **UI Enhancement**: Connect placeholder buttons in `ExerciseLibrary.tsx` and `WorkoutLibrary.tsx` to service operations
- **User Feedback**: Add toast notifications and confirmation dialogs
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with background sync

## Key Files to Review
1. **Task Document**: `docs/tasks/library-crud-operations-implementation-task.md` - Complete implementation plan
2. **Service Layer**: `src/lib/services/libraryCollectionService.ts` - CRUD operations already implemented
3. **UI Components**: 
   - `src/components/library/ExerciseLibrary.tsx` - Exercise library with placeholder "Add Exercise" button
   - `src/components/library/WorkoutLibrary.tsx` - Workout library with placeholder "Add Workout" button
4. **Data Provider**: `src/providers/LibraryDataProvider.tsx` - Centralized data management with automatic refresh
5. **Menu Actions**: `src/components/powr-ui/workout/ExerciseMenuDropdown.tsx` - Menu system for enhancement

## Starting Point
Begin with **Phase 1: Exercise Library CRUD** by:
1. Setting up toast notification system (Radix Toast or similar)
2. Connecting the "Add Exercise" button in `ExerciseLibrary.tsx` to `libraryManagementService.addToLibraryCollection()`
3. Adding remove functionality with confirmation dialog

## Dependencies to Check
- ✅ LibraryCollectionService - Complete CRUD operations implemented
- ✅ LibraryDataProvider - Centralized data management working
- ✅ ExerciseLibrary/WorkoutLibrary components - UI 90% complete
- ✅ Universal NDK Caching - 70%+ performance optimization active

## Success Criteria
- Users can add exercises/workouts to personal library with one click
- Users can remove items with confirmation dialog
- Toast notifications provide immediate feedback
- Operations complete in <500ms with optimistic updates
- All changes properly sync to Nostr network via NIP-51 collections

**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 days maximum
**Confidence Level**: Very High (90%+) - Foundation complete, minimal implementation needed
