# Library Tab NIP-51 Implementation Task

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive Library Tab with three sub-tabs (Exercises, Workouts, Programs) using NIP-51 collections architecture, leveraging existing proven services and UI components while adding first-time user onboarding with POWR starter content.

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists Now (Reusable Assets)
- **WorkoutListManager.tsx** - Proven "List of Lists" NIP-51 architecture with 867-903ms performance
- **DependencyResolutionService** - Complete batched resolution with CACHE_FIRST optimization
- **DataParsingService** - Full NIP-101e parsing with LRU caching and validation
- **WorkoutCard** - Multiple variants (compact, discovery, social) perfect for library display
- **POWR UI Components** - Tabs, Cards, Buttons, Badges, etc. from established design system
- **Authentication System** - Working NDK authentication with proper security patterns

### What's Missing
- **LibraryTab Component** - Main tab interface with three sub-tabs (the tab and subtabs already exists)
- **Library Management Service** - NIP-51 collection CRUD operations
- **Library Onboarding System** - First-time user experience
- **Collection Management Hooks** - React hooks for library state
- **Bookmark/Save Integration** - Add to library functionality from other tabs

### Related Implemented Features
- **WorkoutsTab** - Template browsing patterns to reuse
- **SocialTab** - Social proof and user interaction patterns
- **WorkoutHistoryProvider** - Data provider patterns to follow

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Alignment
- **Service Layer Architecture** - Pure business logic services following `.clinerules/service-layer-architecture.md`
- **NDK-First Patterns** - Leverage existing NDK cache optimization from WorkoutListManager
- **POWR UI Components** - Use established component library per `.clinerules/radix-ui-component-library.md`
- **XState Integration** - Follow anti-pattern prevention rules from `.clinerules/xstate-anti-pattern-prevention.md`

### üö® CRITICAL: No Hardcoded "Fluff" Data
- **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: Star ratings, popularity metrics, fake social proof numbers
- **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: Multiple trainer attribution, "top trainers" language
- **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: Hardcoded user reviews, engagement metrics we don't track
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Use only real NIP-101e event data (exercise names, descriptions, format arrays, equipment tags, difficulty classifications)
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: Display actual collection counts, legitimate workout durations, real parameter interpretations
- **‚úÖ REQUIRED**: POWR-only content sourcing - no fake multi-trainer collections

### Updated Architecture: Collections (Not Programs)
- **Three Tabs**: Exercises, Workouts, Collections (renamed from Programs)
- **Standardized D-Tags**: Consistent POWR collection identifiers across users
  - `powr-exercise-list` - User's saved individual exercises
  - `powr-workout-list` - User's saved workout templates  
  - `powr-collection-list` - User's subscribed collections from others
- **Collections Scope**: Any NIP-51 collection (exercises, workouts, future programs with scheduling)

### Core Technical Patterns
1. **Reuse WorkoutListManager Architecture** - Extract proven "List of Lists" patterns
2. **Service Integration** - Use DependencyResolutionService and DataParsingService
3. **Component Reuse** - Leverage existing WorkoutCard variants and POWR UI primitives
4. **Read-Heavy Operations** - Focus on display and simple add operations for this sprint
5. **Validated Starter Content** - Use DataParsingService to validate NIP-101e compliance

### Performance Requirements
- **<500ms Collection Resolution** - Maintain WorkoutListManager performance standards
- **CACHE_FIRST Strategy** - Use proven NDK caching patterns
- **Batched Operations** - Follow established batching patterns for efficiency
- **LRU Caching** - Leverage DataParsingService caching for parsed results

### Sprint Scope Management
- **‚úÖ This Sprint**: Read-heavy operations, display collections, subscribe to others, simple bookmark adds
- **üîÑ Future Sprint**: Complex list modifications (remove items, reorder, bulk operations)
