# Smart Workout Confirmations Implementation - Kickoff Prompt

## Task Summary
Implement context-aware confirmation dialogs for workout CRUD operations that provide intelligent warnings based on workout progress. The system will prevent accidental data loss by showing appropriate warnings when users try to remove exercises with completed sets, while keeping simple confirmations for operations without progress to avoid confirmation fatigue.

## Key Technical Approach
- Create reusable `SmartConfirmationDialog` component with context-aware messaging
- Implement `workoutConfirmationService` to analyze exercise state and generate appropriate confirmations
- Integrate with existing XState activeWorkoutMachine without breaking current CRUD event structure
- Enhance ExercisePicker with unified search across personal library and subscribed collections (optional)

## Primary Goal
Improve user experience during active workouts by preventing accidental loss of workout progress while maintaining smooth workflow for simple operations.

## Key Files to Review
1. **Task Document**: `docs/tasks/smart-workout-confirmations-implementation-task.md` - Complete implementation plan
2. **Current CRUD Implementation**: `src/components/powr-ui/workout/ExerciseMenuDropdown.tsx` - Existing dropdown menu
3. **Active Workout Interface**: `src/components/powr-ui/workout/ActiveWorkoutInterface.tsx` - Main workout interface
4. **XState Machine**: `src/lib/machines/workout/activeWorkoutMachine.ts` - Current CRUD event handling
5. **UI Component Standards**: `.clinerules/radix-ui-component-library.md` - POWR UI patterns

## Starting Point
Begin by analyzing the current ExerciseMenuDropdown component to understand how CRUD operations are currently triggered, then create the SmartConfirmationDialog component following POWR UI design patterns. The existing CRUD functionality is working perfectly, so this is purely an enhancement to improve user experience.

## Dependencies to Check
- Existing CRUD operations are fully functional (✅ Complete)
- ExercisePicker UI has been fixed (✅ Complete per user)
- XState activeWorkoutMachine handles all CRUD events properly (✅ Complete)
- POWR UI component library is established (✅ Complete)

**Note**: This is an enhancement task, not critical for MVP. Core CRUD functionality is already working perfectly.
